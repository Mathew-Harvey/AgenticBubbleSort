# Sorting Society: Collective Intelligence Simulation

## Overview
An interactive visualization exploring how sorting algorithms adapt to obstacles, inspired by Michael Levin's research on basal cognition and collective intelligence. The system demonstrates emergent problem-solving behavior through local interactions of agents with different "personality types."

## Features
- **Modified Bubble Sort**: Adapts to different agent behaviors
- **Three Agent Types**: 
 - Scientists (evidence-based movement)
 - Normies (social pressure-driven)
 - Stubborn (immovable obstacles)
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the sorting process adapt and evolve
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor sorting efficiency and group behavior
- **Interactive Controls**: Assign agent types and control simulation speed

## Core Concepts
- Goal-directed behavior in simple systems
- Adaptive problem-solving without central control
- Collective intelligence through local interactions
- System plasticity when facing obstacles

## Technical Details
Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, featuring:
- SVG-based visualizations
- Asynchronous operation handling
- Real-time data charting
- Modular code architecture

## Installation
Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

## Usage
1. Click on bars to assign personality types
2. Press "Start" to begin the sorting process
3. Watch how the system adapts to obstacles
4. Use controls to pause/reset/adjust speed
5. Toggle "Under the Hood" to view the code
